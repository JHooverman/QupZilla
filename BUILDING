  If you can, you should use precompiled packages for your distribution.
  But if you cannot use them, or they are not available, please read
  this informations before compiling.
  After your binary is successfuly compiled, you need to copy bin/ folder
  from git to specific directory by your system you compiled for.
  If you are unsure where is the right place, you can check it directly from
  QupZilla by clicking from Help Menu to Informations about program, then in 
  Path section.                     

>> Microsoft Windows <<
>>                   <<

  You need Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 2008
  or higher in order to build QupZilla. If You want
  use JumpLists in Windows TaskBar, then You need
  Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 2010 and define W7API (more info at the bottom)
  If you don't meet this, please use precompiled versions,
  which are also in smart windows installer.
 
>>   Linux / Unix    <<
>>                   <<

  There is no extra dependency, you only need Qt tools.
 
>>        OS/2       <<
>>                   <<

  I cannot provide support for QupZilla on OS/2 as I don't have access to 
  machine with OS/2, but it is possible to get QupZilla working there.
  There may be some more things to do, but as far as I know, you need to
  add Q_WS_WIN define to qmake.
  You will do this by adding one line
               
               DEFINES += Q_WS_WIN
               
  to QupZilla.pro file.

## Available Defines ##
#######################
  You can set define directly in project file (QupZilla.pro)
  or set environment variable by
    $ export NAME="true"

 General:
     UNRELEASED_BUILD     QupZilla won't check profile version,
                          thus, it won't reset your profile is lower version
                          (disabled by default)
                          
     USE_WEBGL            Enable WebGL. You need to build QupZilla with WebKit built
                          with WebGL support, otherwise you won't be able to compile
                          without errors.
                          (disabled by default)
                       
 Windows specific defines
     W7API                Enable Windows 7 API support
                          Requires Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 2010
                          (disabled by default)
 
 Linux / Unix specific defines:
     NO_SYSTEM_DATAPATH   By default, QupZilla is using /usr/share/qupzilla/ path
                          for storing themes, translations and plugins.
                          By setting this define, QupZilla will use path of execution.
                          (disabled by default)

General 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you can, you should use precompiled packages for your distribution.
  But if you cannot use them, or they are not available, please read
  this informations before compiling.
  After your binary is successfuly compiled, you need to copy bin/ folder
  from git to specific directory by your system you compiled for.
  On Linux, you can easily do it by running make install.
  If you are unsure where is the right place, you can check it directly from
  QupZilla by clicking from Help Menu to Informations about program, then in 
  Path section.
  
  You may want to build QupZilla with debugging symbols (for generating
  backtrace of crash) as easily as adding one line to QupZilla.pro:
               
               CONFIG += debug
               

Microsoft Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You need Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 2008 or higher and Qt Libraries 4.7.0
  or higher in order to build QupZilla.
  Building with Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 2010 is also possible, but as this
  version is not yet suported by Qt, created binary can be executed, but is very 
  likely to unreasonable crash randomly.
  Building with MingW is perhaps possible too, but MingW QtWebKit crashes with 
  every Flash, so MingW is not officially supported.
  If you don't meet this, please use precompiled version, which is also in smart 
  windows installer.
 
Linux / Unix
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There is no extra dependency, you only need Qt tools.
 
OS/2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I cannot provide support for QupZilla on OS/2 as I don't have access to 
  machine with OS/2, but it is possible to get QupZilla working there.
  There may be some more things to do, but as far as I know, you need to
  add Q_WS_WIN define to qmake.
  You will do this by adding one line to QupZilla.pro:
               
               DEFINES += Q_WS_WIN


Available Defines
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You can set define directly in project file (QupZilla.pro)
  or set environment variable by
  
    $ export NAME="value"

 General:
     UNRELEASED_BUILD     QupZilla won't check profile version,
                          thus, it won't reset your profile is lower version
                          (disabled by default)
                          
                          example:
                          $ export UNRELEASED_BUILD="true"
                          
     USE_WEBGL            Enable WebGL. You need to build QupZilla with WebKit built
                          with WebGL support, otherwise you won't be able to compile
                          without errors.
                          (disabled by default)
                          
                          example:
                          $ export USE_WEBGL="true"      
                       
 Windows specific defines:
 
     W7API                Enable Windows 7 API support
                          Requires linking against libraries from Microsoft Visual C++
                          Compiler 2010
                          (enabled by default)

 
 Linux / Unix specific defines:
 
     NO_SYSTEM_DATAPATH   By default, QupZilla is using /usr/share/qupzilla/ path
                          for storing themes, translations and plugins.
                          By setting this define, QupZilla will use path of execution.
                          (disabled by default)
                          
                          example:
                          $ export NO_SYSTEM_DATAPATH="true"
                          
     QUPZILLA_PREFIX      You can define different prefix. Prefix must contain ending slash.
                          (default prefix is "/usr/")
                          QupZilla binary will then be moved to PREFIX/bin/, use
                          PREFIX/share/qupzilla/ as datadir, PREFIX/share/applications for
                          desktop launcher and PREFIX/share/pixmaps for icon.
                          
                          example:
                          $ export QUPZILLA_PREFIX="/usr/"

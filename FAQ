Q: Where are all my profile data stored?

A: Go to Menu Help -> Informations about application and then scroll to 
   Paths section.


Q: I have bookmarked a page, the star icon is shining, but I cannot see
   the bookmark in Menu nor Bookmark Panel. Where is it?
      
A: When you add a bookmark from the star icon, it is automatically added
   to unsorted bookmarks folder. You will see it only in Library (Ctrl+Shift+O).
   You can move the bookmark to other folder in star icon or in Library.
   

Q: I am getting a lot of SSL errors when visiting secured (https) pages.
   Why is that?
   
A: Your system CA Certificates list is probably too small or even missing.
   You can check it in SSL Manager (Preferences -> Privacy -> SSL Manager).
   If this is your case, you have to download ca-bundle.crt file from
   https://github.com/nowrep/QupZilla/tree/master/other/ca-bundle.crt .
   It contains certificates from Debian's ca-certificates package and I am
   trying to update it as soon as it is updated in Debian repository.
   
   After downloading this file, you may put it into $yourprofile/certificates/
   directory or in some other place, but then you have to add new certificate
   path in SSL Manager (last tab - settings).

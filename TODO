TODO List
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some features, which I plan to implement in future.
The list is not sorted by priority.

* Import / Export Bookmarks
* FTP Protocol support
* Zoom Widget in statusbar
* Password Manager: save more than one account for site + input completer
* New LocationBar completer
* QFileSystemWatcher reloading local files
* (KDE) Nepomuk integration
* Own FileType detect for downloads (based on suffix)
* Page previews as tooltip on tabs (like Opera)
